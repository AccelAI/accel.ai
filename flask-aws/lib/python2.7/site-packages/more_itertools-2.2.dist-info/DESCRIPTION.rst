More Itertools
==============

I love itertools; it's one of the most beautiful, composable standard libs.
Whenever I have an iteration problem, there's almost always an itertools
routine that fits it perfectly. Sometimes, however, neither itertools nor the
recipes included in its docs do quite what I need.

Here I've collected several routines I've reached for but not found. Since
they are deceptively tricky to get right, I've wrapped them up into a library.
We've also included implementations of the recipes from the itertools
documentation. Enjoy! Any additions are welcome; just file a pull request.


Full Documentation
==================

Please see http://packages.python.org/more-itertools/api.html for the list of
routines.


Version History
===============

2.2
    * Added ``iterate`` and ``with_iter``. (Thanks, abarnert!)

2.1
    * Added (tested!) implementations of the recipes from the itertools
      documentation. (Thanks, Chris Lonnen!)
    * Added ``ilen``. (Thanks for the inspiration, Matt Basta!)

2.0
    * ``chunked`` now returns lists rather than tuples. After all, they're
      homogeneous. This slightly backward-incompatible change is the reason for
      the major version bump.
    * Added ``@consumer``.
    * Improved test machinery.

1.1
    * Added ``first`` function.
    * Added Python 3 support.
    * Added a default arg to ``peekable.peek()``.
    * Noted how to easily test whether a peekable iterator is exhausted.
    * Rewrote documentation.

1.0
    * Initial release, with ``collate``, ``peekable``, and ``chunked``. Could
      really use better docs.
